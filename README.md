# OpenBoatUtils
OpenBoatUtils is a client mod that gives server plugins an interface to modify boat physics. If you want to play with modified physics, you can join servers that support OpenBoatUtils (like `frosthex.com` and `mc.boatlabs.net`, where certain tracks have modified physics), or you can test the mod with commands in singleplayer.

# Features:
- Stepping up blocks
- Modifying slipperiness of blocks
- Modifying slipperiness of air and water
- Jumping
- Modifying gravity strength
- More

There is more information about the features and how they work on the [wiki](https://github.com/o7Moon/OpenBoatUtils/wiki).

For plugin developers, the wiki also includes [documentation for the packet api](https://github.com/o7Moon/OpenBoatUtils/wiki/Packets).
