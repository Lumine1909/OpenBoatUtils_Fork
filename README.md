# OpenBoatUtils
OpenBoatUtils is a client mod that gives server plugins an interface to modify boat physics. If you want to play with modified physics, you can join servers that support OpenBoatUtils (like `frosthex.com` and `mc.boatlabs.net`, where certain tracks have modified physics), or you can test the mod with commands in singleplayer.
